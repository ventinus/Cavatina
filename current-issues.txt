-modal doesnt close on clicking the x
-logo image error 404
-get search to net results
-style form
-figure out how to get images to heroku

think about for DRY
-could include ensure_current_user_creator! method in application_controller? to cover both posts and reservations

would like:
-clickEvent renders modal edit form
-dayClick in dayView to render new reservation form with start_time set
-messaging to establishment on "contact us" page
-have room image linked in the database.
